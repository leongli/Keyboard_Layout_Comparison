# Keyboard_Layout_Comparison
Welcome to the KeyLogger Typing Experiment repository! This repository contains the code and details for an Android application designed to conduct an experiment evaluating the efficiency of different keyboard layouts on mobile devices. The full report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pQU1-UywmazvgQSpE0UWPUUFh25QlHBqlC6zkQnBUBg/edit?usp=sharing)

## About the Experiment
The experiment aims to analyze the typing speed and accuracy of three keyboard layouts—QWERTY, DVORAK, and MessagEase—on an Android mobile device. The study involves participants from York University and utilizes our Android application, KeyLogger, to track typing performance across multiple trials for each layout. [Here](https://youtu.be/jqlrC6dFPmA?si=2yho1P0BaPNTl58S) is a demo of the app.

### Methodology
The experiment employs an observational approach, where participants transcribe passages using the different keyboard layouts on a Samsung Galaxy A54 smartphone. The KeyLogger app records typing speed, accuracy, and user feedback via questionnaires to compare the efficiency and user satisfaction with each layout.

### Contents
• **App Code:** Contains the Java code for the KeyLogger Android application developed using Android Studio IDE.

• **Screenshots:** Screenshots of the app interface showcasing the QWERTY, DVORAK, and MessagEase keyboard layouts during the experiment.

• **Results:** Statistical analysis and findings from the experiment, including accuracy and typing speed results per layout.

### How to Use
To replicate or further explore the experiment:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the app code into Android Studio IDE.
3. Run the app on an Android device or emulator to simulate the experiment setup.
